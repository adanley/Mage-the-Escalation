# Mage-the-Escalation
A spaceships game inspired by EVE Online, Mage: the Ascension, Escape Velocity, and probably just about 
anything else I've read or played in the fantasy / science-fiction genres. 

This project is intended to help me learn the C++ language, in light of an at-work injury that renders me incapable of 
my normal duties.

I'm aware that ~100% of what I have written to this point will become obsolete within, at most, two months. 
I am okay with this: it just underscores how far I will have come over time.

It's going to be a long trip, and despite it being my own tutorial, help is appreciated as long as you don't mind if I ask 
why you did something in the way you did. 

It's a beautiful day to advance a skill. It's an excellent morning for coding. Let's get started.
